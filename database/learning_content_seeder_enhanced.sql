- Inventory management
- Payment processing
- Search and recommendations
- Order management workflow
- Customer data management
```

### Case Study 2: Real-time Analytics Platform
```
Design real-time analytics system:

**Data Volume:** 1M events per minute
**Processing:** Real-time aggregations, alerting, dashboards
**Latency:** <1 second for alerts, <5 seconds for dashboards

Architecture components:
- Data ingestion layer
- Stream processing
- Storage strategies
- Query engines
- Visualization layers
- Alerting systems
```

## Architecture Documentation and Communication

### Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
```
Create an ADR for this architectural decision:
[Decision context]

Format:
- Title: [Brief description]
- Status: [Proposed/Accepted/Deprecated]
- Context: [Forces and constraints]
- Decision: [What was decided]
- Consequences: [Positive and negative outcomes]
- Alternatives: [Other options considered]
```

### Architecture Diagrams
```
Create architecture diagrams for:
[System description]

Include:
- High-level system overview
- Component interactions
- Data flows
- Deployment architecture
- Security boundaries
- Monitoring points

Use appropriate diagram types (C4 model, UML, etc.)
```

## Performance Architecture

### Performance Requirements Analysis
```
Define performance requirements:

**User Experience:**
- Page load times
- API response times
- Search response times
- Real-time update latency

**System Capacity:**
- Concurrent users
- Transactions per second
- Data processing throughput
- Storage growth rates

Design architecture to meet these requirements.
```

### Performance Optimization Strategies
```
Optimize architecture for performance:

**Caching Strategies:**
- Application-level caching
- Database query caching
- CDN for static content
- Edge computing

**Database Optimization:**
- Indexing strategies
- Query optimization
- Connection pooling
- Read replicas

**Application Optimization:**
- Asynchronous processing
- Lazy loading
- Resource optimization
- Algorithm efficiency
```

## Security Architecture

### Security-First Design
```
Design secure architecture:

**Security Requirements:**
- Authentication and authorization
- Data encryption (at rest and in transit)
- Network security
- API security
- Compliance requirements

**Security Layers:**
- Perimeter security
- Application security
- Data security
- Infrastructure security
- Monitoring and detection
```

### Zero-Trust Architecture
```
Implement zero-trust principles:

- Identity verification for all access
- Least privilege access control
- Continuous security monitoring
- Encrypted communications
- Micro-segmentation
- Device trust verification
```

## Architecture Evolution and Maintenance

### Evolution Planning
```
Plan architecture evolution:

**Current State:** [Existing architecture]
**Future State:** [Target architecture]
**Constraints:** [Time, budget, risk tolerance]

**Migration Strategy:**
- Incremental vs. big-bang approach
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Rollback procedures
- Performance impact assessment
- Team training needs
```

### Monitoring and Observability
```
Design observability into architecture:

**Metrics:** [Key performance indicators]
**Logging:** [Structured logging strategy]
**Tracing:** [Distributed tracing approach]
**Alerting:** [Alert conditions and escalation]

**Observability Stack:**
- Metrics collection (Prometheus, DataDog)
- Log aggregation (ELK, Splunk)
- Tracing systems (Jaeger, Zipkin)
- Dashboards and visualization
- Incident response integration
```

## Best Practices Summary

### Design Principles
1. **Simplicity First:** Start simple, evolve as needed
2. **Loose Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between components
3. **High Cohesion:** Group related functionality together
4. **Scalability by Design:** Plan for growth from the beginning
5. **Reliability Focus:** Design for failure scenarios
6. **Security Integration:** Build security in, not bolt on
7. **Observability Native:** Include monitoring from day one

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-engineering for unknown future requirements
- Ignoring non-functional requirements
- Neglecting operational concerns
- Poor error handling and recovery
- Inadequate security considerations
- Insufficient monitoring and alerting
- Lack of documentation and knowledge sharing

## Next Steps
Practice these concepts by designing architectures for different types of systems. Start with simple systems and gradually increase complexity as you gain confidence.',
