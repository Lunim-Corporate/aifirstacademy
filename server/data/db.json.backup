They excel at understanding context and generating human-like responses.\n\n## Key Concepts:\n\n### 1. Context Window\nThe context window is the amount of text the AI can \"remember\" in a single conversation. Most models have limits (e.g., 8K, 32K, or 128K tokens).\n\n### 2. Tokens\nTokens are pieces of text the AI processes. Roughly:\n- 1 token ≈ 0.75 words\n- 1 token ≈ 4 characters\n\n### 3. Temperature\nControls randomness in responses:\n- Lower (0-0.3): More focused, deterministic\n- Higher (0.7-1.0): More creative, varied\n\n## Best Practices for Engineers:\n\n1. **Be Specific**: Instead of \"write a function,\" say \"write a Python function that validates email addresses using regex\"\n\n2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant information about your project, tech stack, and constraints\n\n3. **Use Examples**: Show the AI what you want with concrete examples\n\n4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on the results you get\n\n## Exercise\nTry this prompt: \"Create a TypeScript interface for a user profile with validation rules and explain each field.\"\n\nNotice how specific requirements lead to better results!"

The Specification Pattern\n```\nCreate a [language] [component type] that:\n- [requirement 1]\n- [requirement 2]\n- [requirement 3]\n\nInclude error handling and comments.\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCreate a Python class that:\n- Manages database connections\n- Implements connection pooling\n- Handles connection timeouts\n- Provides retry logic for failed connections\n\nInclude error handling and detailed comments.\n```\n\n### 2. The Example-Driven Pattern\n```\nWrite a [language] function that takes [input] and returns [output].\n\nExample usage:\nInput: [example input]\nOutput: [example output]\n\nRequirements: [specific requirements]\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nWrite a JavaScript function that converts camelCase strings to snake_case.\n\nExample usage:\nInput: \"getUserProfile\"\nOutput: \"get_user_profile\"\n\nRequirements: Handle edge cases like empty strings and single characters.\n```\n\n### 3. The Incremental Pattern\n```\n1. First, create a basic [component] that [basic functionality]\n2. Then, add [feature 1]\n3. Finally, implement [feature 2]\n\nShow each step separately.\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n❌ **Vague requests:** \"Make this better\"\n✅ **Specific requests:** \"Optimize this function for better performance by reducing time complexity\"\n\n❌ **No context:** \"Write a login function\"\n✅ **With context:** \"Write a Node.js login function using JWT tokens for a REST API\"\n\n❌ **Too broad:** \"Build an app\"\n✅ **Focused:** \"Create a React component for user authentication with form validation\"\n\n## Practice Exercise\n\nTry creating a prompt for a function that:\n- Validates API responses\n- Handles different error types\n- Returns structured error information\n\nUse the CLEAR framework!"
