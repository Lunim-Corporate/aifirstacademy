They excel at understanding context and generating human-like responses.\n\n## Key Concepts:\n\n### 1. Context Window\nThe context window is the amount of text the AI can \"remember\" in a single conversation. Most models have limits (e.g., 8K, 32K, or 128K tokens).\n\n### 2. Tokens\nTokens are pieces of text the AI processes. Roughly:\n- 1 token ≈ 0.75 words\n- 1 token ≈ 4 characters\n\n### 3. Temperature\nControls randomness in responses:\n- Lower (0-0.3): More focused, deterministic\n- Higher (0.7-1.0): More creative, varied\n\n## Best Practices for Engineers:\n\n1. **Be Specific**: Instead of \"write a function,\" say \"write a Python function that validates email addresses using regex\"\n\n2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant information about your project, tech stack, and constraints\n\n3. **Use Examples**: Show the AI what you want with concrete examples\n\n4. **Iterate**: Refine your prompts based on the results you get\n\n## Exercise\nTry this prompt: \"Create a TypeScript interface for a user profile with validation rules and explain each field.\"\n\nNotice how specific requirements lead to better results!"

The Specification Pattern\n```\nCreate a [language] [component type] that:\n- [requirement 1]\n- [requirement 2]\n- [requirement 3]\n\nInclude error handling and comments.\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nCreate a Python class that:\n- Manages database connections\n- Implements connection pooling\n- Handles connection timeouts\n- Provides retry logic for failed connections\n\nInclude error handling and detailed comments.\n```\n\n### 2. The Example-Driven Pattern\n```\nWrite a [language] function that takes [input] and returns [output].\n\nExample usage:\nInput: [example input]\nOutput: [example output]\n\nRequirements: [specific requirements]\n```\n\n**Example:**\n```\nWrite a JavaScript function that converts camelCase strings to snake_case.\n\nExample usage:\nInput: \"getUserProfile\"\nOutput: \"get_user_profile\"\n\nRequirements: Handle edge cases like empty strings and single characters.\n```\n\n### 3. The Incremental Pattern\n```\n1. First, create a basic [component] that [basic functionality]\n2. Then, add [feature 1]\n3. Finally, implement [feature 2]\n\nShow each step separately.\n```\n\n## Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n❌ **Vague requests:** \"Make this better\"\n✅ **Specific requests:** \"Optimize this function for better performance by reducing time complexity\"\n\n❌ **No context:** \"Write a login function\"\n✅ **With context:** \"Write a Node.js login function using JWT tokens for a REST API\"\n\n❌ **Too broad:** \"Build an app\"\n✅ **Focused:** \"Create a React component for user authentication with form validation\"\n\n## Practice Exercise\n\nTry creating a prompt for a function that:\n- Validates API responses\n- Handles different error types\n- Returns structured error information\n\nUse the CLEAR framework!"

Error Analysis Template\n```\nI'm getting this error in [language/framework]:\n\nError message: [exact error]\n\nRelevant code:\n```[language]\n[your code]\n```\n\nEnvironment:\n- [language] version: [version]\n- [framework] version: [version]\n- Operating system: [OS]\n\nWhat's causing this error and how do I fix it?\n```\n\n### 2. Performance Issue Template\n```\nMy [component/function] is running slowly:\n\nCode:\n```[language]\n[your code]\n```\n\nCurrent performance: [describe current behavior]\nExpected performance: [describe desired behavior]\n\nInput size: [typical input size]\nEnvironment: [relevant environment details]\n\nHow can I optimize this for better performance?\n```\n\n### 3. Logic Bug Template\n```\nThis [function/component] isn't producing the expected output:\n\nCode:\n```[language]\n[your code]\n```\n\nTest case:\nInput: [test input]\nExpected output: [what should happen]\nActual output: [what actually happens]\n\nWalk through the logic and identify the issue.\n```\n\n## Advanced Debugging Techniques\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis\n```\nAnalyze this code step by step and identify potential issues:\n\n```[language]\n[your code]\n```\n\nFor each line, explain:\n1. What it's supposed to do\n2. What could go wrong\n3. Suggestions for improvement\n```\n\n### Code Review Style\n```\nReview this code for bugs and improvements:\n\n```[language]\n[your code]\n```\n\nFocus on:\n- Logic errors\n- Edge cases\n- Performance issues\n- Security vulnerabilities\n- Code style and best practices\n```\n\n## Real-World Example\n\nLet's debug a common issue:\n\n**Problem:** JavaScript async function not working\n\n**Effective Prompt:**\n```\nI have an async JavaScript function that's not working correctly:\n\n```javascript\nasync function fetchUserData(userId) {\n  const response = fetch(`/api/users/${userId}`);\n  const userData = response.json();\n  return userData;\n}\n```\n\nWhen I call it, I get [object Promise] instead of user data.\n\nEnvironment: Node.js 18, using fetch API\n\nWhat's wrong with this async function and how do I fix it?\n```\n\n**Why this prompt works:**\n- Specific problem description\n- Complete code example\n- Expected vs actual behavior\n- Environment context\n- Clear question\n\n## Practice Exercise\n\nCreate a debugging prompt for a situation where:\n- A loop is running indefinitely\n- You suspect it's related to the loop condition\n- You want to understand why and how to fix it\n\nInclude all necessary context!"
